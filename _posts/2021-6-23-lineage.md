LineageOS 18.1 for Huawei P8 Lite 2017

*** Stable Version ***

**About**

> LineageOS is a free, community built, aftermarket firmware distribution of Android 11, which is designed to increase performance and reliability over stock Android for your device.
>
> LineageOS is based on the Android Open Source Project with extra contributions from many people within the Android community. It can be used without any need to have any Google application installed. Linked below is a package that has come from another Android project that restore the Google parts. LineageOS does still include various hardware-specific code, which is also slowly being open-sourced anyway.
>
> All the source code for LineageOS is available in the LineageOS [Github repo](https://github.com/LineageOS). And if you would like to contribute to LineageOS, please visit out [Gerrit Code Review](http://review.lineageos.org/). You can also view the [Changelog](http://www.cmxlog.com/17.1) for a full list of changes & features.

NOTE: The signal icon is buggy due to Huawei weird ril implementation, I am still looking to fix it over the new Android 10-11 telephony changes.

If you are getting Error 70 while flashing gapps just resize system from TWRP !
If gapps are giving network errors or other kind of errors install them after first boot !
